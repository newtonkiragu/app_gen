- possibly have a gray encoding
	eg. {gray:50}

	- a gray level in range of 0-100, being black to white
	- encoding name is gray, so can use {'encoding name':value} scheme for specifying value
	- its an encoding for sRGB
	- when encoding, average components to produce gray value ((tuple [0] + tuple [1] + tuple [2]) / 3 / 255 * 100
